🚲 Data Analysis: Bike Purchase Trends
This project explores factors influencing bike purchases through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

🔹 Key Steps:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preparation:

   1️⃣ Created a working copy to prevent accidental modifications.
  
   2️⃣ Removed duplicate entries using all columns.
  
   3️⃣ Standardized gender values ("M" → "Male", "F" → "Female") and formatted income as currency.
  
  :four: Introduced an "Age Bracket" column using a nested IF statement to classify individuals as "Young," "Middle-Aged," or "Old."
      =IF(L2:L1001 > 50, "Old", IF( L2:L1001 > 30, "Middle-Aged", IF(L2:L1001 < 31, "Young", "Invalid")))

✅ Data Analysis & Visualization:

  Pivot Tables:
    1️⃣ Analyzed the impact of gender & average income on bike purchases.
    2️⃣ Assessed how commute distance affects purchasing behavior.
    3️⃣ Examined the relationship between age brackets and bike purchases.

  Interactive Dashboard:
  
   1️⃣ Visualized insights from pivot tables using charts.
    
   2️⃣ Enhanced with three slicers for filtering by education, region, and marital status.
